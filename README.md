# E-Commerce-Company-SQL-Case-Study
This project simulates a real-world ecommerce analytics scenario where SQL is used to extract business insights from transactional data.

As a data analyst, the objective was to analyze customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and inventory efficiency to support business decision-making.

The dataset includes:

Customers (customer_id, name, location)

Products (product_id, name, category, price)

Orders (order_id, order_date, customer_id, total_amount)

Order Details (order_id, product_id, quantity, price_per_unit)

Over 20 structured business questions were solved using SQL to simulate real-world analytics tasks.

Business Areas Covered

This case study focused on four major business areas:

Customer Insights

Product Analysis

Sales Optimization

Inventory Management

Each SQL query was written to solve a specific business question.

Analytical Approach
1. Revenue and Sales Analysis

Calculated total revenue across all orders

Measured monthly sales trends

Identified peak sales periods

Calculated Month-on-Month growth

Analyzed largest revenue decline periods

Measured average order value fluctuations

Business Insight:
Revenue trends helped identify high-performing periods and potential slowdowns. Peak periods provide opportunities for targeted campaigns and inventory planning.

2. Customer Behavior Analysis

Identified top cities by customer count

Segmented customers into categories

Analyzed customer engagement depth

Identified high-value customers

Measured purchase frequency

Calculated purchase rate

Analyzed customer acquisition trends

Measured customer growth trends

Business Insight:
High-engagement customers contribute significantly to revenue. Acquisition trends highlight growth momentum and marketing effectiveness.

3. Product Performance Analysis

Identified highest revenue-generating products

Analyzed category-wise customer reach

Evaluated product category performance

Identified low-engagement products

Measured purchase of high-value products

Business Insight:
A small set of products drive a large share of total revenue. Low-engagement products may require pricing, marketing, or repositioning strategies.

4. Inventory and Turnover Analysis

Measured inventory refresh rate

Identified highest product turnover

Determined restocking requirements

Analyzed stock performance relative to sales

Business Insight:
Products with high turnover require proactive inventory management. Slow-moving products increase holding costs and impact profitability.

SQL Techniques Used

Multi-table INNER JOIN operations

GROUP BY and HAVING clauses

Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
